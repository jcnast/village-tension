character interaction platform

This is probably my personal favourite thing I have worked on to date, as it is the first self-web project I have worked on since gathering some semblance of experience outside of work (again, contact me to see those projects- they are incredible).

While simple in itself, I envision it being part of a larger game that breaks through, what is in my mind, the current monotony of the RPG genre of games. This is my key to having an RPG different from all the rest and a key component in any great game ever since I played Fable oh-so-long ago.

This is an interactio platform to have characters with different opinions act differently for each player, even as it they continue through the game.

It will make every character unique in the game in terms of interactions, goals, lines, actions and anything else I can think of.

The UI is basic, as are the current beggining commands, but the ineteractions are complex and varied.

For more variations, spam click the generate-characters button to have as many characters as possible. Though this will require more interactions to get a feel for the full scope of what this can provide. For further elaboration (unless you want to read the code) feel free to contact me.
